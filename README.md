# cubicTI

This file (cubicTI.py) contains the code for trigonometric interpolation for orthogonal cubic volumes.

Fast visualizations of your 3D data can be performed by using either:<br>
a) plotvista() : Plots any 3D numpy array as a cube, with a colorbar/heatmap<br>
b) slicedplot() : Plots the 3D numpy array's 3 orthogonal planes that slice it through it's center, with a colorbar/heatmap<br>
c) dualplot() : Plots the above described heatmaps on the same plot as a single image, with a colorbar/heatmap<br>
